=== How to use ===
All commands are run through rake

To create a new test:
rake newtest[testname]

The following command will run the [feature_name] feature tests using webkit (headless mode):
rake [feature_name]:webkit ==> example: rake test:webkit

The following command will run the [feature_name] tests using firefox on the local system:
rake [feature_name]:selenium  ==> example: rake test:selenium

The following command will run the [feature_name] tests using chrome on the local system:
rake [feature_name]:selenium browser=chrome ==> example: rake test:selenium browser=chrome

The following command will run the [feature_name] test against something other than the production/live site:
rake [feature_name]:webkit apphost="http://admin-dev.streetline.com/"
        ==> example: rake test:webkit apphost="http://admin-dev.streetline.com/"
        ==> example: rake test:selenium apphost="http://admin-dev.streetline.com/"
        
        
The following command will run single test case: rake <project_name>:single[<feature_name>.feature,selenium]
        ==> example: rake sa:single[applications.feature,selenium]
